Numerical experiments on matrix theory related theorems. After inferring the calculation method of $\Delta\mathcal{J}$, we can determine whether there is causal emergence in the macro states after coarse-graining. Next, we will find an optimal matrix $W$ to maximize the degree of causal emergence $\Delta\mathcal{J}$ \cite{Hoel2013,Zhang2022}. To solve this problem, we will firstly discuss the upper bounds related with the two terms, the determinism emergence and degeneracy emergence
